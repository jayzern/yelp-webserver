I don't have an allergy to onions, I just really detest them. If I can get something without them, so I'm not paying for something that I won't eat, I will. I think that makes perfect sense! Her response was that they just didn't put those ingredients on the menu!

First, we need a POE switch. You'd think since you own more than 9 cameras this should be a simple task for a company that specialises in cameras \"and things\". BUT Lorex outsources their customer service! THAT right there should explain it all, but let me let you know the details.\n\nSO! We call a month ago and are on the phone with tech support for 6 hours trying to figure out why a few particular cameras were not functioning properly. It was discovered that we should get the POE switch replaced (Ticket #17400). I call and I am on the phone for 45 minutes. The person that picks up the phone barely understands English and starts reading a script completely unrelated to our discussion. I request to speak with a manager, so I get Ren (Employee #76400) I am told he is a manager. Ren explains to me that he would need to create a new ticket under the customer service department and not the tech to do the exchange of equipment. I explain to him that I do not want to lose the information that was discussed from the previous conversation (ticket 17400) because of how long it took them to figure it out in the first place. Ren tells me not to worry and a new ticket needs to be created. Afterwards, he goes on to say that Lorex will be shipping a new POE switch to us and we would need to send the old one back. THE SAME thing we did with a previous camera! So I agree and the conversation is done (3 hours later) and I hang up. THIS IS WHEN I SHOULD HAVE CALLED RIGHT BACK, because NOTHING was emailed to me afterwards.\n\n2 weeks have now gone by and nothing has arrived. I call to check status, that is when I am told that the POE switch was never sent because they need a $150. deposit. NEVER in the hole conversations that took place prior was that EVER brought up! SO I ask to speak with a manager (or what I am told is a manager), Keith. Keith wanted to take the time to explain to me the \"warranty\" situation and that because it has been longer than 90 days a deposit must be made in order for them to ship a part to me. Its a 150 dollar hold, THEY SHOULD PAY US FOR ALL THE TIME WE HAVE TO WASTE ON HOLD WITH THEM! I express to Keith this ridiculous situation and how long we have waited only to find out we have to pay to get this started all over again AND his response was as if he could care less. As if I should have known. As if he enjoys pissing off customers. So I ask for his employee number, Keith says he doesn't have an employee number (SHOCKING, the other \"manager\" did!?!) but his name would be attached to the ticket number #17400 and that it would be emailed to me. He never asked for my email. SO I tell him that, he tells me if I can confirm that email for him. I know this game, its when you know you just got caught in a lie and you get the \"customer\" to fix it for you. SO I give it to him, and he says that he will send me the information. He asks if he could put me on hold to speak with another department about collecting my payment for the deposit. He puts me on hold for 10 to 15 minutes and comes back and says the credit department is busy and that he will have them contact me back. UN REAL right?!? \"Not really, have you seen the other posts. These guys DONT CARE!\". So he \"thanks\" me for my call and we hang up. \n\nThat was an hour ago, NO email, NO call\n\nTo be continued.....\n\nIt has been 4 business days now, no one from the credit\/payment department ever contacted me back. No one from the customer service department followed up with me (Email or phone call) and now I am calling AGAIN to try and get this completed. Currently speaking with employee, Bella (Employee #76371). Richard (Ext. 50125) the manager tried contacting the payment department AGAIN, only to get back to me and inform me that the department is again too busy OR has closed for the day (I called at 130PST). Someone from that department will contact me either today or tomorrow. Side Note: Keith the original manager said I would be receiving email confirmation of our last discussion, never did.\n\nNext day, as of Noon PST no has called us back to collect payment for the switch. I called them myself and spoke to a customer service rep by the name of Stacy (Ext. 59513) informed me that the payment department was \"unavailable\" and that someone would call me back in 24 to 48 hours.","date":"2016-02-12 18:13:17"}

I can see how people might love it if they're into that yum-yum sauce \/ dynamite kind of thing - I'm not particularly fond of this style of American sushi fusion, but again, I can see how people might go crazy for it. Pretty damn tasty, but not my thing.\n\nGarlic Shishito peppers were great - lightly tempura'd and dusted with a mildly spicy paprika-like powder. \n\nThis is a cool, cozy sushi bar space. I know people have expressed their fondness for the upstairs, but I like how it feels sort of 'cozy Greenwich Village sushi spot' downstairs. A very social atmosphere. I found myself having conversations with other parties along the sushi bar.

I got the gyro and it was delicious. It's not your typical gyro you would get at a Greek place. It's beef, not lamb, includes a pickle (kind of weird at first but I embrace it now), and not nearly as greasy\/messy. It's a much healthier version (I think). \n\nI didn't know they had a restaurant location and boy was it a pleasant surprise! The menu at the restaurant is a lot larger than what they offer at the mall. I have had multiple things on the menu. My go-tos are the gyro, roasted chicken pita, and the greek salad (which is huge). All of them are delicious and I could come here again and again. Oh, the hummus is good too but you'll want to order extra tomatoes or cucumbers (for a charge) because they never give you enough. However, with so many great places to try in the area, I'm trying to dine at a new place every time I eat out so I haven't been back in a long time. This might need to change though. Writing this review is making me want Pita Jungle really badly! \n\nThis location also has an outdoor patio to enjoy when it's not scorching hot.

The mojitos were BOMB though. \n\nThat said... the food was actually pretty good. We had the salt and pepper squid (yummy!), spicy tuna roll (small, and could've been spicier, but still good), chicken skewers, some others, and I also tried the Japan Relief Roll (all the money goes to Japan relief ppl, order it!) which was also really tasty - combo of spicy tuna, eel, wrapped in a soy paper wrap. \n\nIt wasn't a bad way to spend $80 (ESP in vegas) but again, if you're going to advertise specials for happy hour, they should ACTUALLY be specials, not just 1\/2 the plate for 1\/2 the price.

She said it was cheap, and good so i thought , what could go wrong there? \n\nThe first time I went there I ordered the crispy tempura roll, and the BBQ chicken plate. These dishes were good and made me want to come back for more. The second time I went to Yum Yum in 2009, I finally noticed that they had an \"all you can eat\" menu. The price for the ability to eat all the sushi rolls, and Hawaiian foods that you wanted was an automatic steal. In 2009 the price for the \"all you can eat\" menu was a dollar or two cheaper, like it really makes a huge difference. Along with the \"all you can eat\" there is the \"all you can drink\" option which allows you to get unlimited sodas or bottled waters from their fridge. One soda or bottle of water usually costs around 1.50-2.00  dollars so you might as well add on the \"all you can drink\" option for another 2-3 dollars extra.\n\nThe first time I ordered the \"all you can eat\" I brought along 5 of my friends to try it with me. They were here visiting from San Francisco, and of course just wanted to eat, eat, and eat. I thought it was a good way to take a break from all the ordinary Las Vegas buffets. We were amazed at all the food options listed on the \"all you can eat\" menu. There was Hawaiian food such as, chicken katsu, BBQ chicken, spam masubi, etc. There was Japanese food such as the MANY types of sushi rolls they offer (One of my favorite parts about this menu, since regular sushi rolls in other restaurants sell for 8-12 dollars). And there was also delicious Korean BBQ. I definitely suggest the short ribs (kalbi).\n\nEvery year when my friends come to visit me, Yum Yum BBQ is always on the list of places to eat at here in Las Vegas. I'm sure the waiter who is always there knows us by now. He is really nice, and has lots of patience when serving a group of people who are all hungry for their yummy dishes.

Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese \"Whooparons\" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin.","date":"2014-02-26 02:54:42"}

Owned and operated by \"4th generation bakers\" per the in-store propaganda and prominently displaying its New York-Italian roots in several of its offerings it was to a quarter-full store that I arrived just moments shy of 9:30 and with elderly servers otherwise occupied I took my time to peruse, the largely automated operation whirring in the background as several younger staff members took turns restocking shelves.

Clearly not expecting the quality of Bouchon or Bonjour given the obvious discrepancy in price and production it was after a short drive and with coffee in hand that my sampling continued and starting small with an entremet of apple strudel the taste simply fell flat, a dry puff pastry with artificial tasting filling that carried right over a slightly superior tart again compromised by a core I'm rather certain was Smucker's supplied.  At this point with expectations decidedly dwindling it was into a soft almond croissant that teeth tore and discarding more than half of the doughy debacle before tasting a fairly forgettable black & white cookie I thankfully found some solace in the sticky pecan bun with ample notes of butter beneath a lacquer of cinnamon-sugar drizzled nuts.","date":"2014-07-29 13:36:59"}

Copiously praised for their haphazard macarons, uglier than most albeit far cheaper, suffice it to say that artificial flavors and colors are the rule at Manon and although the caramel and cherry both offered a crisp break into creamy filling the others were frankly gummy and unappealing even for $1.10.

or a completely Vegetarian selection - would be well advised to take a look at the lightly battered Kabocha Curry that features the sweet Gourd complimented by Bell Peppers and Spinach atop Rice with just a hint of Garlic in a vibrant and creamy Red Curry Sauce.\n\n****1\/2 -

I've been to XS a few times and finally went to Surrender this past trip. Both are beautiful, both are new and shiny, both have pools, the list goes on and on. But what is actually the difference and why go to one over the other? This is what I think I've figured out.\n\n1. Surrender can only be truly enjoyed when the weather isn't cold or windy. Of course this is subject to debate and depending on how many drinks you've had, could be no problem. BUT, if you are a girl and sensitive to cold temperatures (like me), I would not recommend coming unless it's warm out. We went on a warmish but very windy night and it was miserable. Everyone was huddled by the heat lamps or just staying in the inside areas. At XS, you can clearly stay inside the whole time if you want. It's not that easy to do this at Surrender b\/c it's mainly an outside set up. \n\n2. Surrender is not your traditional dance club nightclub. There's practically no dance floor. So if you are coming to get down on the dance floor, you might have to settle for getting down... well, anywhere you find some space. OR... walk on over to XS and get down there :). That said, if you have ppl in your group who aren't that into dancing, this might be the perfect place b\/c you can still enjoy all the other perks of the place w\/o dancing: there are gaming tables like XS, multiple bars, plenty of places to stand around and talk\/hang out, etc. \n\n3. You can't put your feet in the pool to rest\/cool off like you can at XS.\n\n4. Surrender is SOOOOO pretty, like amazing-take-your-breath-away beautiful. The lights, the set up, the pool, it's truly beautiful and you will be taking so many pictures. I promise.\n\n5. There are actually places you can sit down if you need to, but I think there are more options at XS.\n\n6. To avoid long lines and get reduced cover for guys and free entry for girls, find a promoter and make sure you have at least equal ratio of girls to guys. We did this and it made things a lot easier\/faster\/better\/you-get-it.\n\n7. Big name DJs like Steve Aoki and Calvin Harris. For me, this is a huge plus, but if you don't like trance\/house music, you might want to stay away from Surrender.... or even all of Vegas for that matter ;).\n\n8. I am in NO way complaining about drink prices in vegas, i get it, it's fine, BUT....  $8\/9 for a small bottle of Fiji water?!?!!! They WON'T give you iced-tap water which is complete BS, it might even be illegal. Fortunately there's drinking fountains around... but wow. \n\nSo which is better...? I think overall, I like XS better BUT... I might change my mind after the memorial day trip. Stay tuned :)","date":"2011-03-22 02:07:31"}

I could've played hockey with this lil sesame covered object. I'm not sure if the bagel was stale or if it was just not meant to be tasty, but me and one of my friends ended up devouring our slabs of smoked salmon with the complimentary bread that was served in baskets...that bread was warm, fluffy and tasty.\n\nFor my main course I went with the Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean seabass) which I believe was grilled in a delightful mix of lemon, butter and olive oil - this was DELICIOUS. Each bite was amazing and even better when I squeezed fresh lemon all over it.\n\nFor desert I was saddened that they had no options in the vanilla or chocolate family so I went with their Walnut Pie with Kaimaki ice cream...I'm not a pie person so I supposed I'm biased but I did not like this pie one bit and the Kaimaki ice cream was incredibly fragrant and tasted like dirt, which after looking \"Kaimaki\" up and learning that it's made using a powder made from the root of an orchid plant, makes perfect sense.

They have an abbreviated menu--kabobs, couple of sliders, hummus and babaganoush, flatbreads, other finger foods and dips, and half off of their drinks.  Not bad, if you ask me, from 4-8pm everyday.  So, we went and even used a Restaurant.com certificate (the other time, they accepted my $35 Groupon).  \n\nI have to say, for Happy Hour, I felt that the place was somewhat dead, but that didn't mean that they lacked in terms of service.  We actually had 3 different people assisting our group of 4.  As soon as everyone arrived and sat, we were promptly greeted by our server and had our drinks ordered.  \n\nWe then proceeded to order lots of the Happy Hour items--6 orders of the beef kabobs with fries (next time, I have to tell them to hold the fries), along with some tziki sauce and garlic dipping sauce, an order of sliders with fries, and an order of hummus, as well as babaganoush.  The hummus and babaganoush came out farily quickly with flatbread, although I felt like our table was swimming in plates and bowls--the hummus and babaganoush were served in such large bowls that the two dishes alone took up about half of the center of the table.  In addition, two of our dinner guests ordered tea, which was brought out in these huge-ass teakettles.  While I like the idea (the kettles came from Teavana, a nice touch), we definitely didn't have enough room for all of this stuff on the table.  Later on, the kabobs came out, along with fries, and by that time, we were practically swimming in fries.  Seriously.  We had two plates full of fries, since all that we wanted was the meat.  \n\nI ended up finishing the portion that I'd ordered, in addition to my boyfriend's.  All I can say is that I wish I would've switched orders with him, since his kabobs came out juicy, tender, and more on the rare side.  Mine, on the other hand, came out well done.  Definitely not the way I wanted them, but then again, I wasn't asked about the how I wanted them cooked.  I practically had to keep dipping the meats into the sauces in order to swallow the last two bites of my kabob.  The only thing I kept telling myself was that it was all worth $8 for the two orders.  \n\nWhile we were chowing down, the wait staff also came around with an order of chicken kabobs and sliders, but unfortunately, we failed to order chicken, and there was a miscommunication from the kitchen, and the sliders were taken to another table--our guy hadn't put in the order correctly.\n\nAt least they came around often enough to ask about drink refills.  \n\nWhen we asked to see the dessert menu, we were told that they're not necessarily a dessert place.  All they had were two varieties of ice cream and a cappuccino cake.  The brutally honest response from the server to go elsewhere for dessert was all that we needed.  We capped off the evening at CPK.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, the bill came to like $50 something with tip and tax.  I'd definitely come back again, but next time, to hold the fries.  \n\nI haven't been out in awhile, but I definitely know that their nightlife scene is more of their forte vs. a food joint.  Lounge and club yes, food and dessert, not so much.  However, for those happy hour prices, I'd be willing to come here again.","date":"2012-01-06 06:12:42"}

Best bet are the à la carte enchiladas (menu says 3.49\/each but they actually ring up less - don't tell anyone) and if you ask for pico de gallo on top, it's free, and you get a big smother of it on your enchiladas. UPDATE (5\/24\/2017): The enchiladas no longer ring up less, and they charge you for pico de gallo. The squeaky wheel got the grease - sorry!\n\nAlways pass on the carne asada here (it's super minced-up and can be rubbery) but do get the carnitas and\/or the spicy fish as proteins. The best in-house hot sauce is Dexter Holland's own Gringo Bandito, which is another plus. They also have the standard Tabasco, Cholula and Tapatío trifecta.\n\nThe retractable garage-door in front of the bar is always open - and this place is almost never crowded.

I really enjoy the different food and flavor profiles from eating eastern cuisine, with Indian and Thai being my favorites. The complexities and layering of flavors and taste are amazing. Chada Thai delivers those things with vibrant balance and lives up to it's well deserved reputation. My GF and I arrived around 5:30 on a Tuesday evening.\n\nSERVICE -\n\nConsidering the day and time, seating was quite available and there was no waiting. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and reviewed the menu. Our server and staff we always prompt and attentive.\n\nFOOD -\n\nWe opened with a Thai Beef Salad (Nua Nam Tok) and Spicy Lemongrass Soup (Tom Yum Koong). Both were simply amazing and popped with flavors and complexity. I could write a page alone on the wonderful flavor layering with just the appetizers.\n\nWe ordered Pad Thai Hor Kai w\/ chicken and the dish was wonderful. The noodles were moist and tender, not limp or soggy. Flavor balance was great with a slight spice and mild\/sweeter finish. Great complement to the rest of our meal.\n\nFor entrees we ordered a whole Tilapia dish (Pla Tod Ka Tiem), a crab curry dish (Sen Mee Kang Pou), and a charbroiled pork dish (Moo Khum Waan). All 3 were staggeringly well made. The Tilapia was whole fried, crispy and not greasy at all, and the fish was moist and tender. Crab Curry was LOADED with pieces of real crab meat and has a smooth sweet open with a very spicy finish. The pork had a nice char, but again, the meat was very moist, tender and FULL of flavor.\n\nATMOSPHERE -\n\nChada Thai is a very small restaurant, so the space can feel a bit cramped and claustrophobic. With that in mind, if there are few patrons like there were this evening, the feel is more intimate. There is some bench seating, which for me is such a no no, but enough individual tables that you don't feel like your sitting in your neighbors lap.\n\nAll and all, the food is truly the star here and carries the establishment all the way to a top rating!! THIS PLACE IS A MUST!!","date":"2014-09-27 19:52:48"}

No sweet and sour mix, just good old fashioned squeezed lime and good quality tequila...beautiful. The margarita with \"attitude\" is probably my favorite with just a hint of jalapeño and some cilantro, achieving a wonderful balance of sweet spicy and earthy.\n\nThe food is not my favorite around, but not disastrous. The chicken enchilada, which is presented more like a lasagna was acceptable, but the sauce was watery and bland. The camarones con chile ajo however was unacceptable. It included something like an English muffin slathered with some red aioli and three small shrimp with no sign of spice at all minus the two dried chile de Arbol included for garnish. But the cochinita pibil was almost a 4.5 star plate. Tender achiote braised pork was legit, the tortillas were nice and warm and the lime crema tart and tasty. But the fried plantain nuggets were black as hell and soggy, and the pickled red onion alas was mushy.\n\nIt's obvious that the chef is more from the yucatan region of Mexico as the indigenous dishes from that region show up strong on the menu, and it would be my guess the best ones...like the cochinita.\n\nIt seems like Taberna is trying to fancy itself more like the Mission in terms of food and drink, but is closer to an On the Border in execution. I still don't understand the giant frozen margarita machines behind the bar. Sore thumb!\n\nWould have been 3.5 stars but the salsas given with chip basket were sans salt!! Absolutely zero flavor except for the occasional cilantro sprig. If every customer who walks through the door is going to have that as a first impression, season it!

Renting a locker costs $50...ridiculous, I know. But you do get to open and close it as many times as you want so I guess that is a \"perk\"\n\n4. Those fancy drinks served in yards?

What I found different about this establishment compared to others is the approach of ordering from their menu.  Our waiter asked us for a price range we're willing to spend.  An example range is $60-$120.  My brother (who's birthday we're celebrating) said about $80 per person.  Next, the waiter asks us what our likes, dislikes, allergies, etc in order to create a unique dining experience for us.  My brother basically said he doesn't want to eat sushi (he didn't feel like it that day), wants to try the gyoza, and definitely want to sample the kobe beef.  After our drinks arrived, we waited about 10-20 minutes before our appetizers and entrees came.\n\nWe tried a variety of food which ranged from gyozas, skewers, sea bass, and kobe beef.  The main attraction is the kobe beef where they bring a large stone that's heated to 700 F for us to cook our thinly sliced beef on.  The waiter demonstrated by taking some butter and spreading it on top of the stone followed by laying the beef on top like it's sunbathing.  After a minute or two, the beef slices were dipped onto 1 of 3 sauces and finally onto our table.  The verdict: mouth watering bliss.

The service and staff are incredible. Everyone is really nice, especially the ladies at the bar. The happy hour menu is such a great deal too, $6 for everything (I think there's at least 8 different items to choose from, including 2 different drinks. I recommend the mojito). I loved the salt and pepper squid (a BETTER version of fried calamari), spicy tuna roll, and the yellowtail seviche (it had a really nice ginger flavor to it). The kobe beef tacos were also amazing. As I mentioned in my previous review, the portions are not the biggest, but when you factor in that this is vegas, you are actually getting pretty good bang for your buck. \n\nThey should use maybe brighter lights inside though, it's kind of tucked away and easy to miss, in my opinion.

Service is lacking, I saw other tables look around for a server so they could order, it took us a while to wave down someone to ask for extra soup... which seemed to confuse the waitress so she asked our original male server to come back and confirm that we wanted extra soup... he said OK. Near the end of the meal it finally came, we thought they forgot about it and didn't feel like asking again. But load and behold when we got our bill they charged us for the extra soup, if you were going to do that you should of told us. Then we can decide if its worth the charge... and you still brought it at the very end when honestly we didn't even care for it anymore. The food was just OK, nothing great. I doubt we will be back again, there are a lot of better restaurants in the area with better service and less MSG. \n\nIf you have a party over 6 they do auto gratuity and its not marked on the receipt (esp. if you paid with a credit card) that has already been charged so careful on over tipping for soso service.","date":"2014-12-02 22:36:33"}

We would order \"2 Galbi and 1 Brisket\" and would receive 1 Galbi and 1 Brisket. We would then order \"2 Galbi and 1 Ribeye\" and would receive 1 Galbi and 1 Ribeye. The game became predictable, and frustrating. Repeat 6 or 7 times and you begin to think that there's a big sign in the back (in Korean) that says \"Only one order of our precious Galbi per table per half hour or you're fired!\" At lease that's how it felt. To top it off, there is a warning on the bottom of the menu that threatens a $25 penalty if more than a 1\/2 lb of meat is left on your table. Seeing this warning was beyond ridiculous and ironic, as at no point was more than a 1\/2 lb of meat served to us at any given time.\n\nThe service was typical LA \/ NYC, which means it was pretty much terrible and the waitresses will actually talk shit about you (in Korean) under their breaths. I saw & heard this several times, especially when we tried to manipulate the temperature of our grill. We had to get the attention of the manager (might have been the owner's wife?) to prod our waitress into filling our 6 empty beverage glasses and our empty banchan dishes. At one point we found a sweet spot by ordering with what appeared to be a servers' assistant: he brought us the 2 Galbi and 1 Whatever that we ordered a few times in a row and we felt like we hit the jackpot - sounds sad, doesn't it? In the end we ordered about 9 plates of assorted meats for an average of 3 servings per person at our table, or about 12 oz. per person. Grill off the fat and that's about 8 oz. of $5\/lb. short rib plus some random banchan and soup for $25. Not a very good value, not to mention it took 3 hours to pry that much from them. This place makes Sura BBQ Buffet look like an oasis.\n\nQuality of food and Woonam Jung retrospective: Almost exactly one year ago, this place opened with a full-price a la carte menu. The $28 single servings of Galbi were some of the most expensive in town, but absolutely the most tender, delicious Korean marinated short rib I've ever tasted. Worth every penny. This legendary Galbi DOES NOT exist anymore at Woonam Jung. Total bait and switch. Don't even think you're getting the same quality with the new (and stingy) AYCE plan. To make matters worse, the banchan they serve is below average, which is surprising because you'd think that it should be at least better than the stuff available at the Greenland Korean Market next door. I can't imagine that the owners of this restaurant actually eat the same grade food as their AYCE customers.\n\nYou guys are being cheapos: The vent hoods weren't turned up to an acceptable level, keeping our friends against the wall in a wall of smoke the entire meal. And, a table for 6 at a truly LA-style KBBQ should have a larger grill than the little circle ones at Woonam Jung. OK enough. 2 stars and I am out for good.","date":"2013-02-01 07:24:41"}

Why else would you pay the equivalent of a mortgage payment for one dinner? I'm exaggerating but not that much.\n\nI have to say they have this place soundproofed extremely well.  Once the front door closes, you no longer feel like you are in a semi-smoky casino nor can you hear the jing-janging of the slot machines.  There is soft piano music playing on the sound system and you really feel like you are away from it all, in a quiet, ultra-classy restaurant.  No thumping Katy Perry music here.\n\nThe service, like during our last visit, was perfect.  Our waiter wasn't quite as personable as the one we had years ago but he was on top of everything at all times, answered all of our questions about the menu, and offered helpful suggestions. Also, his team of assistants and bus staff were excellent.\n\nWe ordered some of the same items we loved the last time:  the crab cake (easily big enough for two to split and it's wonderful), the Caesar salad (again, easily shareable for two people, made tableside, delicious), and the Dover sole (melt in your mouth wonderful).  This time, I went with the veal saltimbocca with proscuitto on top and it was very good but not otherwordly.\n\nThe cocktails are incredible here but be forewarned:  they are huge and probably equal to two drinks anywhere else.  The wine selection is excellent, too, but we only did wines by the glass.\n\nYou get complimentary chocolate covered fruits and mints at the end of your meal and also the gigantic, magnificent fruit bowl which no one in the history of time has ever sampled, as far as I can tell.  I am not sure anyone really needs to order dessert here, with the freebies and the massive amounts of food, but the dessert cart does look wonderful.\n\nThis restaurant is very, very expensive but keep in mind that you are paying for perfect service, along with excellent food.

Not that it's an awful thing that the Koreans have monopolized the dining scene, but I don't necessarily want to see Kalbi and Bulgogi on a menu next to Burgers or a sushi menu. Just because a place does one type of Asian food well, does not mean it does them all well, in fact, quite the opposite seems true.\n\nAfter that long rant, here is my review:\nKonnichiwa is a diamond in the rough, located on adorable Baldwin Street, which is adorned with quaint patios, rustic signs, and tucked away on what otherwise looks like a small residential road. I love Udon, and up until I walked into this adorably decorated, small but clean haven, I had felt like all Toronto had to offer was noodles in semi-flavored water... Konnichiwa's Udon had the perfect ingredients! The tempura, although a somewhat smaller portion than I'd like, was crispy and cooked just right. My boyfriend's ramen was amazing, the garlic in the soup, although not particularly authentic, was surprisingly tasty... One of the best I've ever tasted. We had the dynamite rolls, which were fresh and the perfect size. We even had to place a second order of Gyoza at the end of our meal because they were so amazingly good!\n\nI suggest that if you want to try Japanese the way Japanese was meant to be eaten, Konnichiwa is your best bet in Toronto!","date":"2009-03-16 22:51:52"}

And the service at Michael's is probably the best I have ever experienced anywhere.  But you will pay for the experience.  Oh yes (*evil laugh*), you will pay.\n\nIt is interesting that this true diamond of a restaurant is tucked inside the South Point casino which is, in all honesty, not exactly a high end place.  But no matter.\n\nSeveral other reviewers have already said it but it bears repeating:  Set aside three hours to dine here.  Got that?  Three hours.  You are going to pay for the experience so, please, don't rush it.  Make your dinner here the special event, not whatever you are doing afterward.\n\nNow, back to the prices.  The prices are the highest I have ever seen anywhere.  They are staggeringly high.  Ridiculously high.  Laugh out loud high (and if you don't laugh, you might cry).  In fact, the prices are so high, I am embarrassed to disclose them because you might laugh at me and maybe throw sharp things at me.\n\nBut here's the thing:  If you are just hoping to eat dinner here and fill your tummy up, then yes, you have paid waaaaay too much.  However, at the end of this meal, if you didn't figure it out earlier, you realize that you are not only paying for the food, but you are mostly paying for being treated like absolute royalty for three hours.  From the maitre d' to the waiter to the busboy, the service simply sparkles.  This is an experience, and not just a dining experience, that you will likely remember for years to come.\n\n(I also highly recommend a visit to the restroom.  I have seen my fair share of horror-show potties, but this one is extremely pleasant.  And, I am told, the ladies' room is also lovely.)\n\nGee, after all this rambling, it looks like I forgot to mention the food.  Much of it is amazing.  Some of it is very good but not great.  A few thoughts:\n\nCrab cake:  Incredible.\nCaesar's salad (prepared tableside):  Yes, yes, yes.  It's wonderful.  Make sure you inhale deeply before you dive in so that you can gather in all of the garlilcky and other terrific aromas.\nDover Sole (finished tableside):  Very good and probably 10 inches long.  \nPepper Steak with brandy sauce (finished tableside):  As big as a football but not spectacular.  It was a bit one-note after the first few bites.\nKey Lime Pie:  Excellent but you probably won't have room to eat any desserts.\n\nAnd yes, everyone gets a dish of chocolate covered fruits (gratis, and they are excellent) and also a giant fruit bowl (free) which looks like it was stolen from Carmen Miranda's head.  The fruit is beautiful but I am not sure anyone in the history of Michael's has ever taken a bite of any of that fruit because you are simply too stuffed to do so.  In fact, the same bowl of fruit might have been passed down for generations of diners here.  \n\nOverall, it's an amazing and truly memorable experience but definitely more so for the service than the food.  The dishes aren't amazingly innovative but they are still very good.  Remember, you are paying for the experience.  If you don't keep that in mind, you have missed the point of Michael's.","date":"2012-12-11 16:31:04"}

The taste of the bacon took over, so halfway through the meal, I separated the two. The steak on its own was very juicy and soft. \n\nJust a tip - the roasted garlic mashed potato side is MASSIVE. Compared to the twice baked potato, the portion is almost double the size! So.. finish your steak before your side.\n\nThe service, like any other Keg, was great. The waiter was friendly and attentive. \n\nAll in all, it was a good experience, but nothing out of my expectations. I wish the wait could be a little shorter and will probably make reservations the next time I come.","date":"2013-01-08 16:16:18"}

This food was filling, good, and just what I asked for, even if it did not completely blow me away.\n\nThe service at Sabor Cubano was friendly and efficient. The portions were large and the flavors were distinct. Was there a slight Mexican flavor to their black beans? There was, but the fish I ordered was delicately breaded with a definitely non-Mexican sweet-smoky seasoning. My dining companion enjoyed his pork chop and the whole experience was satisfying.\n\nPrices are a bit higher than the standard Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood. Dinner plus a non-alcoholic drink and a shared appetizer will probably run you close to $25 for your half. The cuts of meat and portions are more substantial than your usual \"hole in the wall,\" however, so the prices seemed totally reasonable.  You can go much more budget with one of the sandwiches, instead of a steak or fish fillet. Next time I drop in, I will be trying the traditional pork sandwich, as I have no doubt it will be tasty.\n\nThe bigscreen TV was playing Gigante Sabado, which was hilarious, if distracting. Based on the various pennants, I imagine there would have been sports on had any favorite teams been playing.\n\nWe were told that there is live music on Fridays. I can vouch for the quiet and relative non-crowd on a Saturday evening, if liveliness is not your thing. \n\nWas this the best Cuban I have ever had? No. But it was good, and a lot of times, that's all dinner has to be.","date":"2010-07-21 17:08:23"}

I did, however, notice a slight discomfort in my teeth from the whitening procedure, but it went away overnight.

This is a fantastic way to try a new activity and explore your creative side without committing to a series of classes. \n\nWhy I loved it:\n-Very hands-on class! Got to do a fair amount of the actual work, which was surprising considering I had zero experience with glassblowing. It's impossible to make a glass trinket completely on your own the first time, but the instructor really tries to let you do as much as possible by yourself and steps in when you need help. So even if you're not a particularly crafty person (like myself), you can definitely get through this class and feel like you've accomplished something by the end.\n\n-Lots of one-on-one instruction. Classes are limited to 4 people so that each person can individually go through the glass blowing process with the instructor. Definitely necessary since there's a lot of delicate timing and dexterity involved in making even a simple paper weight. \n\n-You make two little baubles to take home, personalized to your taste with whatever colors, patterns, shapes you want (within a certain skill level of course). You have to come back a few days later to pick them up since the glass has to cool in a special oven over several hours.\n\nOther info\/tips:\n-My instructor was Dan, the owner of the studio, who was very hands-on as mentioned above. He does the morning sessions and his associate Zach does the afternoon sessions. \n\n-Wear shoes that cover your entire foot (i.e. not flats) for your own safety and bring a water bottle since it can get hot in the studio.\n\n-There is a small parking lot right in front.\n\n-When you pick up your bowl\/cup, they can smooth off the bottom to help it lie flat. However, this may take away some of the color there. If you're like me and would rather have a lopsided bowl with all it's color intact, don't do this.","date":"2015-09-21 03:36:39"}

I get to the hotel, and low and behold, the shuttle was available and actually about to head out to the airport for another drop off\/pick up. Then, I go to the check in, only to find 6 other fellow stranded passengers in front of me. Stranded person #1 and #2 tell me that they've been waiting for 20 minutes for the front desk people to help reaccomodate since the entire hotel was booked. How I can simultaneously book and pre-pay for a room 20 minutes ahead of time, pay for a cab I didn't need to pay, and then get to a fully booked hotel at now almost 2am is ridiculous. Then, I and stranded passenger #3 get on the phone and make some calls, and after a minute, I find availability at the hotel next door. The front desk expressed shock and said, WOW, I've been trying to get on the phone with them to reaccomodate you all! uh, no you didn't, you were trying to find availability at another Hyatt, all of which were probably booked for the night too due to the mass of stranded travellers.

It's pedestrian and bike-friendly, and most students don't have cars. I usually biked to class, most of which were held in Van Hise, a fairly unattractive piece of architecture. The more historic buildings are much nicer (they are always doing construction to build or upgrade something or another). I used to study at Helen C. White library and play frisbee on Bascom Hill between classes. And spending an evening at the student union or The Rathskeller... or better yet, on the Terrace itself, listening to music, playing cards, drinking beer and watching the sailboats (or that one boat that looks like a vintage car)... it's heaven.  \n\nI lived in the Sellery dorms, which are these outdated high-rise buildings, but I loved it. They had everything a college kid needed, including cute boys. The campus food was nothing special, except that Ed's would make these delicious mint-Oreo blizzards, and they delivered pizza, nachos, sandwiches and even Raisinets right to your dorm door if it was too cold to go outside. Pop's was the standard cafeteria, and I don't know how many of us ended up accidentally stealing those huge pink water glasses... I may still have one. After the dorms, there are lots of slumlords in Madison who will be happy to have you from sophomore until senior year. :)\n\nObviously, I'm aware of UW's reputation as a party school, but I kind of embrace it. The student body at Madison is generally bright, fun and has it together, so much so that they can party from Thursday 'til Sunday and still make it to class on time.\n\nAs far as academics, I think the language programs are some of the best in the country. They offer more languages here than at most (if not all) American universities. I majored in Spanish Literature, and I liked my program a lot, though there were one or two tenured teachers that were a little unorthodox. I also took a lot of science classes for my pre-med requirements (there's no actual pre-med major here though). I absolutely my physiology and anatomy classes (the lab was with real cadavers, which is pretty cool for undergrads) and didn't love physics... the rest of the science classes fell somewhere in between. I didn't take advantage of having a major adviser as much as I should have, but I'm sure that there are some great mentors in all of the UWs departments.\n\nLast, I have to talk about Badger football, because there is really nothing like being in the stands of Camp Randall on a fall afternoon (or even being outside the stands, playing flip-cup with your friends' alumni parents under the falling leaves). Everybody is wearing red and everybody knows the cheers and everybody sings the songs... and everybody knows when to jump around. It's a crazy feeling to be part of something so big. I'm getting chills just thinking about it.\n\nOn Wisconsin!","date":"2010-08-16 01:34:25"}

It's pretty average and I've been to worse in Markham (Yellow Tail). Gal's has lunch specials so the bento boxes are better priced and come with a decent amount of stuff so that is usually my go to dish. It's like your typical bento box set elsewhere comes with miso soup, salad, rice, and your choice of a couple of sides to customize the box.

I honestly thought that the burgers were good, the teas were refreshing, and the service was excellent--she came around quite often to check up on us.  \n\nHowever, I didn't appreciate the fact that the menus were not updated and I changed my order a few times because the menus didn't accurately reflect what was being served--burgers and dessert options, as well as tea selection.  I didn't feel like a wrap so I don't know if they have updated that section or not.  They actually only had one option for dessert, and I wish that I would've known that prior to walking in, as the black forest cake looked delicious, but was a bit dry in my opinion (had to eat it later on since I was so stuffed).  \n\nI was lucky enough to find a parking spot when I did, since it is in a plaza that shares parking with a lot of other restaurants and shops.\n\nI like this place and hope to return at another time since I did like the food, atmosphere, and service.

It's an absolute sugar bomb and unlike any other cappuccino I've ever had.  For me, this WAS the dessert (and honestly, even though the sugar levels were off the charts, it was pretty darn good).\n\nNot a bad experience at all but really, no strong reason to return.","date":"2018-03-13 21:27:51"}

Talented passionate performers, singers dancers, costumes and actors overall well coordinated team.\n\nHighlight of this particular venue, performance is literally center stage, round - so great seats all around! Ha! Which is unlike the other cirque shoes I've seen which are usually more theater like stages. It seriously contributed to a scene in the show where the audience participates in creating an illusion! I don't want to spoil it but it was my favorite.. so amazing from the top overview, curious what the underneath was like.  Very creative set accessories, and costumes.

The service was really good with waiters coming in decently often to check up on us, fill up our waters, etc. The experience might be different if you're sitting in the main dining area, but it was very pleasant for me.\n\nThe chicken, waffles and watermelon had really good and juicy. The waffles tasted really fresh and had a nice sweet taste to it. The waffle was made really well and I like the watermelon a lot. Each piece was a good solid cube (they chose good watermelon or the good parts of the watermelon) and has nice spice that compliments the sweetness well.\n\nMy friend had chicken too which was kind of dry, but that may have been an exception.

They have several rows of dogs (and cats) for you to look at. Of course, there were a few that pulled at my heart strings. If a dog is found, their policy is to wait 4 days before anyone can adopt it. A few weeks later, we came back since I was once again running errands in Tempe Marketplace. The one baby pup wasn't there anymore but we saw a Pom mix that my bf just had to get. They had just found him so we needed to wait 4 days before we could come back. Exactly 4 days later, we came back and asked to take him out. He was super shaky and scared, poor thing. We decided to get him though! He wasn't fixed and needed shots so we were told that we had to come back a few days later to get him. On the paperwork, it told us that he could be picked up in their Phoenix location. \n\nLiving in Scottsdale, the Phoenix location was quite a hike. We went right after work during rush hour which didn't help too. By the time we finally made it there, we were told that he wasn't there and that he was at the Mesa location. So we had to drive all the way back to Mesa to finally pick him up. The whole cost was about $72 for rabies shots and to get him fixed. It also included a free vet visit within a certain time frame which we didn't have the chance to use. \n\nOverall, the adoption process was pretty painless (although the wait in line is pretty bad). One star off for the bad communication and making us run around town to pick up our pup. Totally worth it in the end though.","date":"2012-09-26 17:21:46"}

I believe during the week they have a happy hour from 4-6, but we went on a Sunday night so no happy hour specials. Either way, the food and drinks were very tasty.\n\nI went with two other people and we shared some of the small plates\/appetizers. The jalapeno corn bread with the butter is so flavorful and just the right amount of jalapeno heat (definitely not spicy) and a very large portion to share. Be warmed: it does have bacon it in but easy to navigate around if you are picky like me. The mac n cheese is totally worth ordering double. We all managed to get 2-3 big scoops of it. The carrots were something different and I'm glad I ordered them. Very flavorful and a bright, fresh dish. The tomoato salad dish was good, but not my favorite out of everything. The tomatos are warm, so it's not a traditional salad but more of a side.\n\nMy friends shared the fried chicken plate which came with 4 pieces and a hot sauce. I don't eat meat, so I did not partake, but they were very pleased and the dish is large (so enjoy sharing!). \n\nI ordered the half sweet, sweet peach tea and it was perfect. Usually sweet teas are TOO sugary, but I'm glad they were able to make it half sweet. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to rush away because I was going to be late for a show, but I will definitely order their dessert next time. They have a peach cobbler they tell you about before you order that takes about 25-30 minutes. Their other desserts sounded great too and all for about $10 each!\n\nCan't wait to come back here during a happy hour next time I'm in Vegas to try some other plates!","date":"2016-02-05 19:46:20"}

If you run across this place in any form, it's a must stop.\n\nSome how my open table reservations got lost in outer space but the wait was minimal. \n\nShortly after being sat, we met our waiter. He had a peculiar attitude throughout our meal. He seemed annoyed to be serving, he provided 0 commentary even when the table made comments to which any other waiter would have had a response to. Maybe just a bad night?\n\nDrinks\n\nBlackberry Bourbon Lemonade:  I could really end it at that. The flavor matches the name and the alcohol's presence was enough. Refreshing. 4\/5\n\nSouthern Peach: The bourbon in this takes over the lightness of the peach puree and sweet tea, it's distribution is in chaser form. 3.5\/5 \n\nFood\n\nMac and Cheese: The 5 different cheeses made it sloppy and scary since I can only eat measured out amounts of dairy. But the taste was good. I enjoyed it at a normal degree but the rest of my table fell in love with it. 3.5\/5\n\nBone Marrow: The onion marmalade surprised me in taste. It has a light sweetness to it that went too magically well with the bone marrow on toast. It's good enough to turn people into bone marrow fans. The portion was big and it cost less than a drink, souther oddities. 4.75\/5\n\nSmoked Brisket Biscuits: The brisket was a hands full. Their \"homemade\" bbq sauce was low on the tang but the cleanliness of the brisket made up for it. The biscuits had a fresh taste but nothing that would have me ordering a side to go. 4\/5\n\nI wanted to taste their take on the ribs but with a long night ahead of me, that would of been a bad idea.

Jerrys has all sorts of stuff! If you're looking for an old album and they don't have it, it's probably because someone came before you to get it. But broadly, they really do have everything: Rock, pop, jazz, classical, soundtracks, alternative, folk and the list goes on.\n\nPrices are amazing. Everything is very cheap. Most albums are in the camp of three to seven dollars though a few are as high as nine. If you go to any large city you'll find any of these albums double or triple what Jerry's is asking. You can't get mad at these prices at all. \n\n\nEverything was organized wonderfully. Jerry's is huge and the fact that everything is so well organized makes a huge difference. If you're like me and there's always few specific records your looking to add to your collection, a place like Jerrys can be overwhelming at first glance. However, if you know what you want the organization of the store makes it super approachable.\n\nThe one caveat is the quality of some the album conditions. A lot of the album covers here are in rough shape. I didn't notice any issues with the records themselves and I looked through a ton. Didn't really see anything in mint and very few items in near mint. \n\n\nAlso, If you're looking for new records don't come here. It's all old stuff.

The crepe was really good, all the savoury flavours blended well and it came out fresh and hot. The linguine was decent, I found it barely had any lobster meat, and it was hard to taste in the over rose sauce.

For me it was on the salty side of everything... but I do like the concept of old style family italian restaurant.","date":"2016-04-28 20:09:17"}

After picking out numerous types of shoes (explaining each purpose and function) and having me try the different types by running out on the sidewalk to narrow down my choices, he showed me different videos that incorporated a different method of running that minimized the heel strike.\n\nHe also told me about various running groups around the Valley, the Track Club, as well as the club at this particular store (meet weekly with tips on running, guest speakers, and a program to help train for the Las Vegas Marathon in December).  \n\nI'm definitely glad that I came by this store.  I ended up buying a pair of running shoes and a pair of cross-trainers.  Although they had more shoes, such as the Vibram  Five Fingers, they also had the Minimus line, in addition to other Lifestyle shoes.\n\nIt was a great experience, and I definitely came to the right place to gain some knowledge and get a couple of pairs of shoes.  I'll be sad to see it close down, though.","date":"2011-07-24 06:46:56"}

It has been in existence since at least 2002, when the early high school versions of my younger brother and me would wolf down burritos together there.  Located in the Golden Link shopping plaza (the one with the Lowe's, Target, and Panera, among other retailers), it can be a pain to get in and out of, but all in all, it's a great location.  Parking is ample, the lines were always speedy back in the day (as they were today when my mother and I picked up dinner there), and they always seem to have nice people working.  The dining patio is also very pleasant; even though the shopping plaza is located next to Route 8, there's a lot of green space blocking the view of the road and muffling the sound of the cars.\n\nI remember once my now-deceased grandmother wanted my brother and I to bring home a burrito for her after the two of us went there together and ate in around 9 pm.  When we were finished, we went through the line again to order the burrito for her, and the people working ended up giving it to us for free, you know, 'cuz it was for grandma and all, and it was 9:50 pm and they were going to be closing in 10 minutes, so why not...  That has always made me feel warm and fuzzy about this Chipotle, so I give it four stars... but not five, since it is a pain to get in to that plaza, especially when coming from the east, as we usually are.  That left-turn lane light on 82 into the plaza takes forever!","date":"2011-05-22 22:40:08"}

The Big Mc gets 4 stars from me for several reasons:\n\n1.   This has got to be one of the BEST places to indulge in my secret pastime of people watching. It doesn't matter what time of day or night, there are always INTERESTING folk either coming or going into Vegas. There is also an over abundance of celebrities (A-list through D-list) and in January, the airport is overrun with porn stars in town for the annual AVN Awards.  \n2.   McCarran has continually evolved; adding amenities not found at other  airports (hello, there is a 24 Hour Fitness center on site), some pretty decent cuisine (Blue Burrito Grill, Gordon Biersch, Uno Pizzeria, Wolfgang Puck Express),  and a plethora of places to get loaded while you wait to catch your flight back home. The Jose Cuervo Tequileria is a favorite.\n3.   The airport is surprising neat and clean (relative term) compared to other places such as O'Hare, LAX, Hartsfield, DFW or Denver.\n4.   If you are in a gambling mood and want either one last shot at the big money, or are just arriving and can't wait until you get to a casino, McCarran has slot machines EVERYWHERE. For some reason I found the ongoing chant of \"Wheel of Fortune\" strangely comforting when waiting for my flights. \n\nNOTE:  Just a hint for those out of towners, though.....I lived there for 5 years and never heard of anyone hitting the jackpot at the airport.\n\nOne downside can be the long waits in the security lines, but then again, this IS an airport in one of the most visited destinations in the world. Expect that travel in on a Friday and out on a Sunday or Monday will require more time to get through the security checkpoints. My advice to those cranky after 3 hours in line? Hit the Tequileria once you get to your terminal, you will feel better immediately, I promise!","date":"2008-08-22 11:20:20"}

Just because it's Arizona, doesn't mean February is warm....we opted to sit inside, but since the entire back of the restaurant is open air, it was pretty much like sitting deep inside a park gazebo, with the wind blowing in every so often creating a slight chill. I'm not complaining (well, I am just a little bit), but be forewarned that you may need some sort of sweater or cover-up even if you choose to sit inside.\n\nI ordered the \"Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Green Chiles, Tomatoes, Cheese and Fries\" and a coke. There were actually onions and lettuce involved, but I didn't eat those or the tomato. I thought the sandwich was pretty tasty; the chicken was cooked perfectly and the green chiles really added that special something to the sandwich. The fries were thick, not thin, and were tasty as well. Refills on soda were free.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the  \"Campfire S'mores\". There were enough ingredients to make 6 s'mores; more than enough for our party of four. Arriving in a cast iron muffin pan, it came with a small can of portable gel that was pre-lit, thus creating the roasting fire. There were wooden skewers for the marshmallows, and plenty of chocolate and graham crackers to go round. It was a fun and delicious concept.\n\nThis place is also known as the Packer Bar, and there is a small area near the front of the restaurant dedicated to the green and gold.

If you feel they don't treat you well here, you can always go next door to the Steelers Bar........good luck with that.\n\nOut back are a few corrals which hold cattle during bull riding events, but that wasn't happening during my visit.

OVERRATED.  I went for the first time back in March and couldn't remember a thing. Then I went back over Memorial Day Weekend to see Markus Schulz, albeit with very high expectations. Overall, wasn't that impressed. \n\nFirst of all, it is INSANELY confusing to get into this club. First floor, second, third, fourth? Where do you start? It is so confusing. Whatever happened to ONE entrance and ONE exit? The other not-so-helping aspect about this already confusing club is that the bouncers\/security people aren't all on the same page. They all tell you different things, sending you on a wild goose chase to find the mystical entrance. We eventually got in, so yay, but I definitely lost my buzz in the process.\n\nThe outside of the club is really cool. It's set up around a pool and there are pretty lights everywhere. The inside... it's regular. The pictures you see on the website don't resemble the inside at all in terms of lighting. It's all black\/dark, I really didn't see anything special about the \"main floor\" at all. There's a huge screen in front of you, but it's really nothing spectacular. Also, the main dance floor area has been described to me multiple times as a \"mosh pit of dancing dudes.\" This couldn't have been more true. \n\nThe funny part is that when you leave, they make you all take the same elevators down to the exit. Oh, so NOW there's one way to exit, but really?? You're going to make thousands of people take the same way out... via elevator? \n\nWhoever designed this place... smh. The bathrooms are in the WORST location, they put them in some back far corner. Clubs aren't supposed to be confusing, especially since you'd expect people to be drunk inside them.

Now on to the spectacularly bland and suburban dry to the touch so called cornbread. UGH! Now to the best part. And I say best because I had to throw everything else in the garbage in disgust! The brisket. It was tender and very well marinated\/seasoned. Everything except the sauce which reminded me of dark ketchup! Horrible sauce! Lastly...the baby back ribs. They would have been tolerable if they were soaked in a decent sauce. But they weren't so they reminded me of some ribs that should be sold prepackaged to truckers next door at 7-11. Truthfully, I am no race baiter or anything but if I go to a joint serving collard greens and get served by a crew of young high school girls the authenticity is going to be questioned right off the bat. Constructive criticism? Get some SOUL in your food. Spice it up! The girl at the front was sweet and more than likely family but you are running a business. I didn't so much as smell a HINT of bbq happening even when I placed my order. You expect to be punched in the nose with the smooth smell of smoke and sizzling meats hitting you before you even get to taste it! This was a watered down experience and that is being GENEROUS.

The chicken found its place in the perfectly melted cheese inside a delicate, square-shaped crepe. The meat was juicy and it was just so tasty. I can imagine .. some baby spinach and oven-cooked chicken instead would've taken it to the next level. Mmmm.....\n\nI would definitely go back for a second run. The drinks look fancy and the prices on the menu are quite reasonable. \n\nIf I were to nitpick this place, it would the speed of service.

It's a cute little European-like escape from the college bars that blanket State Street and University Avenue. \n\nThe crowd seems to lean toward the hipster\/grad student-types. It was Saturday night and packed to the brim when I was there with my friends. I ordered a strong Jameson and ginger ($4.50) downstairs and then we headed upstairs. We thought it would be less crowded. It wasn't. We were lucky enough to snag a big table and another small one on this little raised stage area though. \n\nThe decor is really cool--like a cross between a Parisian theater and a Barcelonan wine bar. There's even a fireplace upstairs! The jukebox music was up to snuff and the other patrons seemed friendly.\n\nGenna's comes out with four stars instead of five for two reasons. \n\n1. The upstairs bathroom was an abomination. It's a one-person deal, and there was no way to lock the door, hang up your coat\/purse, wipe yourself or dry your hands. To make things harder (when you're trying to hold the door closed AND pee at the same time), the toilet seat had been broken off and was laying next to the sink... had to pull The Hover. Ugh. \n\nI found a credit card nesting in the used towel roll piled on the bathroom floor, and I brought it up to the bar. And this brings me to gripe number two.\n\n2. One of the upstairs bartenders was really bad. He was practically having (and yelling) an entire conversation with his friends from behind the bar, all while ignoring me. I finally got his attention to give him the lost credit card, and then he gives a hearty thanks and immediately walked away without letting me finish telling him about the broken bathroom situation. Plus, I had wanted to order a drink. It was just kind of weird how he walked away so abruptly and didn't look back when I was waving him down. I ended up leaving and coming back a little bit later. Someone watching me wait again at the bar said, \"He's great when he's actually serving you... but not when he's not.\" You said it, man.","date":"2010-11-08 15:23:33"}

She reserved us four spots on one of the \"holiday tours\" that the Phoenix Herpetological Society offers. Cost is $20 for adults and $15 for seniors. (I'm not sure how much children cost; we did not have any in our group.) It was advertised as being two hours in length. We like learning and animals, so we drove out to the desert (almost to Carefree) for the 11 am tour with excitement.\n\nOur tour guide, Aaron, did a fantastic job explaining the mission of the animal sanctuary and teaching us all about the animals that we saw on the property. The PHS has been open for 15 years and cares currently for 1,800 animals. 80% of the animals are former pets (legally or illegally owned), and they work closely with Game and Fish to rescue animals. When zoos close, PHS takes in animals, and when PHS helps the animals become healthy enough to place in zoos, they do so. I now will never forget the difference between tortoises and turtles and crocodiles and alligators! I love that PHS works closely with schools and children's camps to promote animal education.\n\nOur 11 am tour group had about 20 people in it, mostly seniors and children. Aaron talked loudly and made that people of all heights had an opportunity to see and touch (if desired) the animals that could be touched. He also provided helpful information like that if folks became a little claustrophobic in the venomous snake tank room that they could move outside to wait under shaded picnic tables for the crocodile and alligator part of the tour.\n\nIt is clear that the owners of PHS and the tour guides and volunteers have such a heart for rescuing and caring for animals. Yay! The downside is that tour guide might not stick to the schedule. As a fellow educator, I know that it can sometimes be hard to keep one's excitement for whatever one is teaching in check. But one has to do it! At the 1 pm mark, we were only just starting the crocodile and alligator part of the tour, and by 1:30 pm, my parents and my boyfriend and I were getting hangry and had reached our max of learning about crocodiles and alligators. Thankfully we were able to find our way out of the maze of outdoor animal environments and leave the tour early, but this meant that we missed seeing the barn of non-venomous snake tanks. Alas, those were the animals that my boyfriend most wanted to see! \n\nI understand that many of the non-holiday tours are 3 hours in length, but this one was described as being 2 hours. So plan accordingly when you book your tour, and be prepared to stand and learn for whatever duration you choose! Anyone who is thinking about getting a turtle, tortoise, snake, or other reptile should definitely come here first before making a purchase for their sake and for the animal's sake.","date":"2017-01-02 19:30:22"}

The train was clean (for public transportation) and graffiti free. I found the honor system of paying for a ticket a little silly since it is my understanding this project was mucho expensive, but hey, I understand you have to find a way to entice those car loving drivers somehow.\n\nUnfortunately for us, the first night I rode the rail with a friend, it broke down 2 stops from our destination. After sitting at the station for 10 minutes with no announcement from the driver, we figured out we probably weren't going anywhere anytime soon.

However, there is one particular dish here that I ALWAYS get, so although I may not be the best judge in determining if this restaurant is particularly good overall, at least I know one thing...their barbarcoa plate is DEEEEELICIOUS!  I mean, I have tried bites of other items on their menu from people that I'm eating with, and they all seem pretty decent, however none of them have compared to the barbarcoa.  It's so tender that no knife is needed; the meat just falls apart when poked gently with the fork.  It comes with cilantro rice, which is really good too, black beans, which I don't really eat cuz I'm simply not a fan of beans, and tortillas.

I know, it sounds bad, but his sis and I have very small appetites, so this was actually a very smart way to go and we still ended up with leftovers!\n\nWe started out with the sampler platter which consisted of hummus, bulani (fried potato and scallion filled pastries), tabouleh and baba ganoush served with yogurt sauce. A la free chips and salsa, warmed pita bread with roasted pepper spread and cilantro chutney were brought out too. Tabouleh...... I get why people like it; it was very fresh, but raw veggies taste gross to me! I picked out the scallions in the bulani and then thought it was very good! The hummus was garlic-y goodness and the baba ganoush was perfect! I've had it at other places where it was as sour as a lemon, but here? Perfection! Pepper spread, another awesome condiment I am newly in love with. Chutney? Don't love it, don't hate it, don't mind it. Sis and I split the Ginger Chicken: breast meat sauteed with ginger and garlic in a light curry sauce with artichokes. Light curry is definitely true! I am a curry lover and, although the dish certainly smells curry-licious, the flavor was very light and mild. Highly recommended for a curry newbie. The artichokes....cooked to perfection. No fibrous parts to chew on, at all. Let the accompanying rice soak up the sauce and enjoy! Hubs ordered Lamb curry: pieces of lamb leg with mushrooms and spinach in a light tomato curry sauce. There were also potatoes in it, but they aren't listed in the menu description. He let me try a little...another delicious dish! Everything seemingly melted in my mouth! Entrees come with either soup or salad. I chose soup, he picked salad. The salad is Romaine based, not iceberg, a definite plus, and hubs reported that the dressing, a very light cucumber concoction, was a nice change. The soup (Mashawa) had onions, chick peas, kidney beans, split peas, chicken and lamb in a tomato-y base topped off with a dollop of yogurt. How many words are there for delicious? For dessert? Baklava, or as they call it, Baghlawa. We split it three ways and our server, a very friendly, kind and funny Russian exchange student, went out of her way to find us the biggest piece. It was served with a piece of lemon candied in honey on top. Am I saying delicious too much? 'Cause that's what it was....yummy, yum, yum, yum!\n\nI don't think there are any Afghani restaurants in the Milwaukee area, Kabul, so if you're ever looking to open a second location, come on over, we'd LOVE to have you!\n\n\n24\/2015","date":"2015-03-01 06:56:28"}

My immediate family did not shop here, but my beloved aunt would take my little brother and me out for lunch at their cafe at least once a year for a birthday or end-of-school celebration, preceded by heavy sampling from their extensive cheese shop and followed by picking up meat at the butcher shop.  When I was little the cafe was located towards the bakery, with a glass wall looking into the space where the deli entrees and sides were prepared by folks in chef coats and hats.  It was so much fun to order bistro food and watch them at work.  Now the cafe has moved to the \"front\" of the store with windows looking out to W. Market Street--a much bigger space filled with natural light.  My aunt and I still go to lunch here when I come back to visit my family, and on our most recent trip a few days ago, my soup combo was as delicious as always.  I especially like that West Point Market works with the Summit County Developmental Disabilities Board to give people with disabilities the opportunity to work as bussers in the cafe.  YAY for businesses that actively strive to support traditionally marginalized folks!\n\nOkay, so I've covered their cheese and butcher shops, the cafe, and the deli prepared foods counter with fancy sides, there is also an extensive wine section and chocolate section.  So many fabulous items here.  And, of, course, the West Point Market also has \"regular\" grocery items as well (fancy versions of non-perishable goods as well as specifically natural and organic ones) and a fruit and produce section.  It would be far too expensive for plebs like me to shop at the West Point Market on a weekly basis were I to still live in town, but this is a perfect store to pick up a gift or a gift certificate or to have a casual but still special lunch.","date":"2011-05-22 17:01:07"}

We called to see if they could push it back 15 minutes but we were told they had a few large parties and unfortunately could only do 7:15.

We even snuck in a small cake for our boss and they brought it out for us with a candle and cut it for us, free of charge. \n\nThey have a small room in the blue circular tower you will see when you walk by. It's their wine cellar plus a private room for about 6-8 people. I would love to eat in there!\n\nWe ordered a few drinks and a few appetizers. 2 ahi tunas, steamed mussles and the crab cake. All of them-wow! The ahi was so fresh and actually very big for an appetizer. The crab cake wasn't mashed up crab, it was huge chunks of blue crab. The steamed mussels were in a delicious broth and also had a lot.\n\nThe chef even sent out a small tasting of crab and spinach on a cracker for us, also amazing! \n\nEverything looked so good that I had a hard time deciding what to get. The entire table wasn't sure! We ordered: scallops, seafood soup, seabass and ahi tuna dinner. Everyone said nothing but amazing things about their meal. I ordered the seabass and I wish the plate never ended. It came with a sweet corn on the bottom-wow. I think next time I will get the seafood soup, it was huge and you literally got to try it all.

Had a reservation for 6:30 and was seated within a couple of minutes. Things got kinda mixed once at the table. Our server was prompt, attentive, and very nice, but never introduce herself (I feel like that should be standard). \n\nOrdered water and a Woodford (neat) and both were prompt to the table, but the water is bottled and they charge for it. I feel like if that's the case, the option for tap at no charge should be offered. Throughout the meal we had to continue to ask for standard things, like plates.\n\nFOOD -\n\nConsidering this the first time here for either of us, we ordered a number of things to try.One word can describe 95% of the meal... DRY!\n\nWe opened with the Cream Corn Fritters and they were prompt to the table. They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Very tasty and, unfortunately, the high point of the meal. Also, I think there may have been problems in the kitchen that night. It was over 40 mins between our appetizer and the entrees. I don't think our problem was isolated, because I didn't see any food coming out of the kitchen for the tables near us either.\n\nFor entrees, we had both the Memphis-Style Dry Rubbed Spareribs and the Mopped Baby Back Ribs. The ribs are huge and very meaty. However, there is no discernible difference between their dry rib and the mopped rib, which should be considered \"wet\".  Flavor was good, but both ribs were no where close to juicy and were very dry.\n\nWe also had the Smoked Chicken and the Texas-Style Beef Brisket. The menu says an order is \"1\/2 smoked chicken\" which should be 4 pieces, but it's really 1\/4 of a chicken since you get 2 pieces of chicken. The chicken pieces were small relative to the ribs, though they tasted good. The Beef Brisket was by far the biggest disappointment. The brisket had very little bark and no smoke ring. It was cut very thin and was dry as doctor's cotton. Literally, would suck every ounce of moisture out of my mouth.\n\nFor sides, we had the Hoppin John (DRY), Kale and Cashew Slaw, Mac and Cheese, Fries with Alabama Sauce, and the Cornbread with Honey Butter (DRY). They were okay, but neither of us ate more than a 2-3 bites of each.\n\nATMOSPHERE -\n\nIt's a casual and fun atmosphere for sure, very welcoming. We sat at a booth, which was HUGE and there seemed to be plenty of space between us and other guests. Nice place for a casual date before the movies or a night with family. I really liked the overall design and layout of the restaurant and could see it being fun for big groups of 6+. \n\nPlenty of TV's in the bar area, but not blasting noise all over the place. Background music was the same, loud enough to create atmosphere but you can still speak with your other guests.\n\nOVERALL -\n\nIt was an okay experience, but I won't be rushing back for a \"second chance\" anytime soon. \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is an appropriate rating for Pot Liquor CAS. That's EXACTLY how I felt throughout the meal. Pricing level is okay overall, but not a bargain by any definition IMHO.","date":"2015-08-16 15:51:25"}

Here's that original review:\n\nDr. Jenni is amazing. Her staff is warm and friendly, and the whole office is run very efficiently.\n\nI would characterize this chiropractor as a very \"low pressure\" doctor. If you've ever been to a chiropractor that tries to tell you that everyone needs a lifetime of adjustments (before they've even looked at your x-rays--or even worse, doesn't take x-rays at all) then you know how awesome her approach is.\n\nShe knows everyone is different with different needs. You won't be a number or a wallet at AmFam. The staff knew me by my second visit and the doctor was asking about non-essential personal stuff (\"how's your sick cat,\" \"did you get the promotion?\") with each patient.\n\nI have gotten two therapeutic massages and both technicians were strong, communicative, and responsive.\n\nDr. Jenni took x-rays of my neck (it had been giving me some grief) and an old break in my arm. We talked through things I could do at home if my schedule (or insurance benefits) wouldn't accommodate follow up visits. \n\nShe is also a doctor that supports nutrition and supplements--which is HUGE in my book. \n\nYou can't go wrong here, and even though I am TERRIBLE about making regular appointments at ANY doctor, I will make sure to get back to this one as needed.","date":"2016-04-10 03:14:01"}

I'm not sure how you can improve upon perfection. Color me impressed!\n\nWe were in town visiting my parents, but we took a day and met up with a friend from college who has been living in Arizona for a while, and he suggested that we meet up here as he's been wanting to try it.\n\nI can't speak for him, but I think he really enjoyed it. I know we did!\n\nWe arrived about 20 minutes before him and ordered a couple of drinks and the duck fat sriracha wings while we waited. Oh, the deliciousness and, not overly messy like some wings....When he arrived, we decided to just order a bunch of small plates and share. It was a little tight, considering that we sat at the bar, but we made it work. Between the three of us, we had the Tuna Chips, Red Miso Seared Kobe, Gojuchang Grilled Octopus, and each of the steamed buns. We ended with a banana bread pudding type thing for me and a date cake type of thing for our friend.\n\nEverything was delicious! The wings had just the right amount of heat, as did the octopus. We were able to taste the flavors through the heat, which many restaurants, IMHO, overlook in favor of simply having a spicy dish on the menu, because it's trendy. The kobe beef was very tender. The tuna chips were a little bland for me, but then I prefer thinner cut tuna as in sushi, versus thick cuts as in poke. The steamed buns were amazing and you really can't go wrong with whichever you choose. The chicken and waffle one was definitely interesting. My banana dessert thing came with a small ramekin of caramel, which made it even better. It was like small banana bread pudding balls that you could dip in the caramel, or drizzle the caramel over the balls and fork 'em. I opted for dunking because.....caramel. LOTS OF CARAMEL. The date cake, while yummy, just wasn't my thing.\n\nAll in all, the flavors of each dish held their own yet melded nicely with one another. Even with the spicy dishes, the heat didn't overpower the food. My husband had beers, my friend drank wine and I had delicious hand crafted cocktails. The service was very prompt, our server\/bar tender was extremely helpful in explaining and recommending items on the menu, and was just downright friendly. Although this place is more of what I consider an upscale restaurant, the service (at least at the bar) was as if we were old friends who had stopped in after a long absence.\n\nI would definitely recommend the Clever Koi and I will definitely be back. \n\n8\/2017","date":"2017-05-15 03:27:26"}

They will write anything you want on it for free. \n\nWhile there, I took advantage of having no line and also purchased a carrot cake cupcake (not my favorite) and the lobster tail. WOW, I figured the lobster tail would be pretty lightweight, but considering it's a custard\/whipped cream mix I should have known. This thing was dense, flaky and delicious. Honestly, it almost had too much filling. I took most of it out and picked around it because I felt guilty for how fattening it probably was, but it's definitely worth trying and splitting with 1 or 5 people :)\n\nSince we paid for the cake the day before, we didn't have to wait in the horribly long line come Saturday evening before dinner, we got there just before our 7:30pm reservation at another place nearby. Thankfully we paid beforehand because the line was INSANELY long. Luckily, the cake ready to go and packaged nicely. All in all, it took just a few minutes to get the cake and head out the door. People looked pretty upset that we walked straight up but hey! we already paid for it.  \n\nThe cake was delicious, moist and flavorful.

Though I didn't partake, the beer list is absolutely fantastic, as it is almost everywhere in Madison (I'm convinced). My fiance ordered a cute Rhinelander shorty while I surveyed the scene of vintage mirrors and comfortably kitschy decor. I decided that this is probably the neighborhood we'd live in if we lived in Madison.\n\nOnce we were seated, our server wasn't the greatest. She forgot a few things, though to be fair I had kind of a confusing\/obnoxious order. I asked for the bad breath burger with no bun, no cream cheese and all the sauces on the side (It came with the bun. I also asked her if she could find out what was in one of the sauces for me, but I had to remind her twice. And there were no onions on either of our burgers, even though the menu says they are supposed to come with them.). I realize my order was annoying in the first place, so I don't want to fault her too much but she did also forget to put in my guy's soup so that came after our burgers did. And she wasn't totally on top of our drinks either.\n\nThe food totally made up for the spotty service though. It's bar food, but all seemingly homemade (down to the ketchup). I'd definitely get this burger again, considering I ate it deconstructed, it was slightly overdone (medium well vs. medium) and it was STILL perfectly delicious. It's an organic burger with green goddess dressing, garlic, hot sauce, tomatoes... and since we realized we were missing our onions, the server brought us a giant cup of caramelized onion goodness. The onions make the dish.\n\nThe burger also came with mixed greens and an amazing orange-Serrano chili-lime vinaigrette. It looks like this dressing also comes on the roasted veggie salad and that sounds wonderful too. I was in the mood for a burger that night, but the special board was really tempting. It was seared scallops with sauteed spinach and I think a bourbon-brown-sugar glaze. And it was only $13 or some such nonsense. That's like stealing.","date":"2012-11-20 18:43:09"}

I'll spill the beans! $15 for the day spa , $48 for either a mud bath, epsom salt bath or milk bath(all kind of out in the open) $80+for massages starting at 25 min-75min$180+tax. Free drinks and warm robe and cute slips. Apples oranges and lots of snack bars to munch on! Not too bad for a 100 degree day here in Vegas! Honestly you get what you pay for. This place definitely needs face lift to compete with the other spas, but maybe they like it small! I'd still come back. Can't beat $15-20 for hotel guest\/non.","date":"2018-07-05 00:35:11"}

The family needed food fast. And I am not talking about plain restaurants, I was talking about delicious sushi chaos! So I knew the perfect place to tame the wild beasts of a family was the one and only, Sushi Twister!  It is also owned by Ramen Sora in Chinatown.\n\nThe trip was a little farther than our home. It was on the other side of town and in a sketchy area. As we got there, we were disappointed and excited because of the long wait in line. It took 20 minutes! But once we got inside, the waitress brought our drinks in a jiffy. Now comes the sushiness you've been waiting for!\n\nSo we started with a large order from the AYCE menu, the long wait had starved us. We got the usual rolls like caterpillar, dragon, and lots of salmon nigiri along with some of  their special rolls like the tiger yamazaki and the sushi-twister and ninja. The \"salmon loves lemon\" was slightly tart when eating with the slivers of lemon, but was oh so good! The crispy vacation roll was crunchy from the garlic flakes with a nice bit of spicy from the tuna.  The orders came so fast that we had to order MORE! \n\nWe ordered the yellow mango with shrimp though the yellow mango was a bit overpowering. The baked scallop appetizer was a little too burnt on top and a bit oily for our taste. Baked mussels were also pleasing. The ordered chicken skewers brought us accidentally to another dish called the pork katsu with a tasteful sauce. All the rolls had good consistency.  The overall experience with the dishes were outstanding, just like the staff's fast and friendly service! \n\nThe interior of the place was a tad bit tight, thus creating the long line. There was a projector screen which had the Sochi Olympics showing. It was a nice size for entertainment. The atmosphere was busy and the chef's were making those great rolls. The prices are comparable in town with kids 8 and under for half the adult prices.\n\nOverall the service and sushi overcame the long wait and trip so I gave them 5 stars. In the end we came home happy, stuffed, and satisfied!","date":"2014-02-23 18:26:47"}

We had to wait approximately 45 minutes due to the limited seating here (14 seats?) and due to arriving at a busy time.  There's only 1 chef and 1 helper at this place so don't expect your food to arrive like a fast food joint.  What's cool about the Oyster bar is that you can watch the chef add all the ingredients to the 6 cauldrons and 2 gigantic pots.  The 6 cauldrons are used to make the soup while 1 of the big pots is filled with fish stock and the other is for boiling the shellfish.  Here's what I ordered (all were excellent by the way):\n\n* 1 dozen raw half-shell oysters: The chef schucked the oysters in front of us.  Looks easy when he does it.  I prefer squeezing the lemon and drizzle some cocktail sauce over them.  Taste great.\n* 1\/2 dozen raw half-shell clams: Similar to the oysters but with a different texture.  I prefer the oysters though.\n* Palace Pan Roast: Combination of shrimp, lobster, crab, clams.  Tomato paste base with white rice.  Can feed 1 or 2 hungry souls.  Did I mention it's loaded with flavor.\n* Oyster Shooters with Vodka: With the cocktail sauce, you won't taste the alcohol or the sea-taste from the oyster.

It actually didn't matter much to me since I was there mainly for the food, but from there on, we were treated like royalty. I especially appreciated the manager coming out to apologize and offer us extras for the night. \n\nNow onto the food.. We ordered a pear puree soup for the appetizer.

Do yourself a favor and walk to the window wall with a handheld mirror to inspect your makeup before purchasing any products. \n\nMakeup\/Products: This is one of two places in Cleveland that sells Bobbi Brown products, which I absolutely love. They also carry Trish McEvoy, Laura Mercier, NARS, and Lune+Aster (Blue Mercury's line). All high-end quality lines. They also happen to have my favorite lip balm (Rosebud salve) which I'm hard pressed to find in any store. \n\nService: I was quickly helped by a sales associate when I entered the store. She helped me decide which shade of corrector and concealer I needed and gave additional recommendations on other products I was interested in. Also, since I am South Asian, I like that the woman who helped me was black. Not that I mind being helped by white people, but I do think that colored women have a better grasp of what other colored women need in terms of makeup, so it's nice that they have a diverse team.  \n\nFree goodies: Truthfully this won't apply to most shoppers, but I happened to be there when they were celebrating their 16th anniversary and the launch of their own makeup line (Lune+Aster). As a result I got champagne, a cupcake, and a free bag of product samples on my way out!","date":"2015-09-12 14:59:21"}

The girls and I needed a quick dinner and it was rather early, so I was hoping there would be no wait.  Luckily, I was right.  When we first sat down, the bus boy brought us water immediately, but then no one came over to us for what seemed like 20 minutes.  We eventually had to flag a waiter down, who was very apologetic and proceeded to provide the best service ever!  Not only was our server very attentive, so was the rest of the staff.  Even the hostess came by at one point to check on us, which I found rather strange but funny, all at the same time lol.  \n\nWe started with the fried lotus chips with mole sauce.  Just an FYI: the fried lotus chips do not come with mole sauce.  The waiter offered it to us for making us wait, I believe, and I sure am glad he did.  The fried lotus chips are good, but a bit plain.  However with the mole sauce, it was delicious!  One of the girls ordered the pozole rojo, which was good, but it was nothing compared to the caldo tlalpeño the other girl ordered.  The caldo tlalpeño was so flavorful that it was hard to believe that it was only soup.  Here's a warning: if you cannot take spice, then the caldo tlalpeño is definitely not for you.  Sorry, sucker lol.  I ordered one each of the lengua taco and the barbarcoa taco, which were both delightful.  Lastly, we shared one order of the diver scallops and green beans in XO sauce.  I love scallops, green beans, and XO sauce...however this was a tad salty.  It was mostly the XO sauce so I made due by not getting too much sauce in each bite, which worked out nicely.  \n\nFinally, to make up for forgetting about us, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert, mango and sticky rice.  I love this dessert anyway so I was pretty excited when he brought it out, but of course it had a twist to it.  Normally, it doesn't come with whipped cream on top, but this one did with what seemed like crispy rice treats inside.  Anyway, I don't normally eat whipped cream since it's so fattening, but I figured hey, I'm on vacation...live a little!  And man, am I glad I did!  Yum!","date":"2013-02-20 07:04:35"}

They had granite counter tops but the shower and some of the detailing in there were from another era, the 80's. \n\nThe pool area was nice although the waterfall was harsher than I expected. Since it was in the 90's, I wasn't complaining. We got out there in the mid afternoon and had no problems finding chairs. \n\nWe had a good time and aside from housekeeping waking us up every morning before 9am, service was great and I'd have no objection to staying here again, especially if Love tickets are involved.","date":"2009-09-24 17:06:15"}

Can you see it? This is how I felt when I walked into Durant's the other night after seeing Brian Regan at the Dodge Theater. \n\nRed velvet flecked wall paper, dark carpeting with a design straight out of a casino and bartenders in ties......this place was the bomb. Our waitress was professional, attentive and efficient. You can tell that some of the wait staff have worked here for years (but not like in that \"I work in a dive diner because I have no other choice\" way). These people CHOOSE to work here, and you can tell they love their jobs. This attitude comes through in how they treat their customers. \n\nWhile I was not that hungry and only had a salad and baked potato, my dining companion ordered the fillet mignon, scallops and garlic mashed potatoes. When he said the scallops were the best he had ever tasted, I skewered one and gave it a try....the rush must be what heroin addicts feel when they shoot up for the first time. It was perfect! Although the fillet was tender, the flavor was a bit off; however even at less than 100% it beat most steak places hands down. My baked potato was anything but ordinary...twice baked and stuffed with cheese and other gooey goodness, it was a meal in itself. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the strawberry shortcake for two. When the waitress pulled up in the crane to drop it on the table, we realized this thing was really for five or six people, not two. The strawberries were covered in a sweet and light glaze, which did not soak through and make the short cake soggy (I hate that). \n\nWe ate in the dining room in front of the bar, which afforded us a delightful view of the incredibly diverse crowd that came in that night. It was both a culinary and visual delight. \n\nThe cherry on the top? Exiting through the kitchen. As I left I thought I could hear the faint sounds of \"Layla\" drifting through the air....or maybe it was my imagination.","date":"2009-05-23 00:53:29"}

My bartender's name was Gustavo - he was fun, personable, charming and attentive. Normally I feel a bit off downing drinks by myself at a bar, nonetheless at a steakhouse (albeit a small one in a casino, lol) he made me feel right at home.\n\nThe restaurant manager needed a charger for his iPhone and his employees didn't have one, but I did so I got free drinks after happy hour...for a few hours and this was great.\n\nThe following day I went back with a few friends and we had the hot rock appetizer (pieces of nicely seasoned and very thinly cut pieces of raw beef sirloin and grill  it yourself with VERY hot rocks in a bamboo steamer like thing) - I LOVED it and thought it was delicious but those with me weren't crazy about it...granted I do agree with them that it would have been tastier had the sirloin pieces been thicker, at $9 I wasn't expecting the stars - when it's NOT happy hour the hot rocks are $17 - THEN I would have been really disappointed, but for $9 I was pleased.\n\nI also had their beef sliders (Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, louis sauce, fries) they were pretty juicy, small and the 'louis sauce' (whatever it was) was quite good. My friends also ordered the crispy calamari and the Finger Licking Lollipop Wings (Signature sauce, blue cheese, carrot sticks). The calamari was ok, nothing to write home about and I didn't sample the wings because I don't do spicy...\n\nMy 4 star rating is really because Gustavo was super cool, I liked the ambience, great happy hour specials, people were friendly (staff and clientele alike!) and the location was convenient to my hotel and to getting our night started. If I come back to Vegas (which honestly, I'm not clamoring to do anytime soon - I mean I'm from NYC ;-D) I'd definitely make a point of stopping back here :).","date":"2012-03-05 19:23:21"}

This time it was free since my bf has M life rewards. The offer was something like 4 free nights .. well they weren't free $30+per night for the resort fee as well as $15 for a limited time for members parking. If not it was $25 or more for parking per day. The room I had last was a queen. We upgraded to a king bed so there for it's the same exact lay out as the red velvet still was there and the red tile in the bath room was the exact same as the retro terrible 70's feature as the queen room. Never again would I stay there I matter how \"free\" it is. \n\nOut of all the places like Vdara, Red rock casino , Mandalay Bay have all been amazing stays. There is absolutely no spa. So I had to walk to New York New York..$15 for their spa it was so old and small and $100 for Aria which is just crazy for that price for my taste. I rather do redrock for $25 for the day and also brand new and gorgeous and lovely scenery. I didn't even make it to there pools due to the being so packed all 3 pools and kid filled with urine I'm sure. \n\nThe windows at Park MGM were very dirty and dusty the casino was still small and not fun places to gamble. \n\nThe only thing on this trip is recommend would be Bavettes steak house. Top notch 5 star restaurant. You can see my review there and how it was the perfect dinner. The carpet smells like smoke, honestly I don't know why the don't demo this place and start fresh. I'm sorry for this review but save you money for somewhere better.","date":"2018-07-09 00:29:12"}

Large open space that's well ventilated with lots of natural light. Plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, free weights, exercise balls, and most equipment you would ever need. It certainly had all the equipment I like to use, including my preferred brand of elliptical (Precor). Not too crowded and I never had to wait for a machine. Facilities are clean and well maintained. They have a variety of classes that seemed to have good attendance when I glanced over. You can get membership for a single week or month, which is great since I'm only ever in the area for short amounts of time. Free wi-fi included for those who stream services on their phone\/iPad. Plus they occasionally have health food\/drink vendors who set up booths in the main lobby and give out free samples.\n\nMinor issues: Late night and weekend hours suck. No digital scale (only a dial scale) for weight measurements. No large mat area for stretching or floor exercises (just the small personal mats). Wifi is occasionally spotty. Also annoyingly had an issue where I explicitly stated I wanted a one month membership on signing up, and then had a recurring charge that I had to call back and complain about.","date":"2015-11-08 23:08:32"}
